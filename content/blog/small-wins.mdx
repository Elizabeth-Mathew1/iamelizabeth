As someone who almost never brags, writing an entire blog about my small wins is way out of my comfort zone. 
But from the countless self-help articles I've read over the year, I guess that's where growth is. 
<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>Also, if I don't speak of my acheivements, who else will?</span>

[insert 100XðŸ§¿]

None of what I've acheived are overnight successes. I'm also almost never the smartest person in the room. Every win has 
come from blood, sweat and tears(a lot if it). It's come from burning the midnight oil consistently, a strong work ethic and
sacrifices you can't even imagine of. 

Also lots of prayers.

Starting off with a most recent one.

It was almost two weeks ago when I started researching heads-down about MCP servers and 
how I could build one for SigNoz(I work here!). So after a lot of research, I started building one. Nothing huge, just a demo MCP server.

The technical writer in me in is urging to explain what MCP is and it's functionalities, but let's press pause on that. For now,
if you are a curious soul, I highly recommend <a href="https://your-blog-url.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">this blog</a>. Anyways, after tinkering and getting my
demo server up and running, I decided to blog my experience.


The blog was primarily around my concept and theories on how MCP servers for observability were just <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}> hype machines</span>. You can read the entire <a href="https://signoz.io/blog/unhyped-take-on-mcp-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">blog here</a>.

About a day after it went live, we saw a sudden (and unexpected) surge in traffic. We hadn't event distributed it yet! On tracking down the source by breaking-down via <span className="italic">custom-intial-referrer</span>, we found that our blog was featured on the<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}> TL;DR</span> newsletter. 

Now, I'm a very pessimistic person and I believe nothing good ever happens to me. So I was naturally inclined to believe that a bot which intermittently scrapes the web, found my article based on some keyword trigger and pushed it to the site. 

Not being able to find another reasonable explanation, I went with that story.

Cut to, two days later, I woke up and was on my bed scrolling through every social media site. My career choices have definitely made LinkedIn one of the first sites I srcoll across. Very surprisingly, I found a DM
from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewztan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">Andrew Tan</a>.

<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>
It's not everyday that you wake upto a DM from an investor at both OpenAI and Anthropic and the founder of TL;DR AI himself.
</span>

And I will forever hold this DM close to my heart. Here's a screenshot.

I've been coding, building and writing for a while now. It's only in moments like these that a lot of other moments when
I questioned my choices makes sense.

Full circle moment.
