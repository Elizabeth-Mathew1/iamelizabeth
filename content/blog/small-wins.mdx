As someone who almost never brags, writing an entire blog about my small wins is way out of my comfort zone. 
But from the countless self-help articles I've read over the year, I guess that's where growth is. 
<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>Also, if I don't speak of my acheivements, who else will?</span>

[insert 100XðŸ§¿]

None of what I've acheived are overnight successes. I'm also almost never the smartest person in the room. Every win has 
come from blood, sweat and tears(a lot if it). It's come from burning the midnight oil consistently, a strong work ethic and
sacrifices you can't even imagine of. 

Also lots of prayers.

Starting off with a most recent one.

## #1 Andrew Tan

It was almost two weeks ago when I started researching heads-down about MCP servers and 
how I could build one for SigNoz(I work here!). So after a lot of research, I started building one. Nothing huge, just a demo MCP server.

The technical writer in me in is urging to explain what MCP is and it's functionalities, but let's press pause on that. For now,
if you are a curious soul, I highly recommend <a href="https://your-blog-url.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">this blog</a>. Anyways, after tinkering and getting my
demo server up and running, I decided to blog my experience.


The blog was primarily around my concept and theories on how MCP servers for observability were just <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}> hype machines</span>. You can read the entire <a href="https://signoz.io/blog/unhyped-take-on-mcp-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">blog here</a>.

About a day after it went live, we saw a sudden (and unexpected) surge in traffic. We hadn't even distributed it yet! On tracking down the source by breaking-down via <span className="italic">custom-intial-referrer</span>, we found that our blog was featured on the<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}> TL;DR</span> newsletter. 

Now, I'm a very pessimistic person and I believe nothing good ever happens to me. So I was naturally inclined to believe that a bot which intermittently scrapes the web, found my article based on some keyword trigger and pushed it to the site. 

Not being able to find another reasonable explanation, I went with that story.

Cut to, two days later, I woke up and was on my bed scrolling through every social media site. My career choices have definitely made LinkedIn one of the first sites I srcoll across. Very surprisingly, I found a DM
from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewztan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">Andrew Tan</a>.

<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>
It's not everyday that you wake upto a DM from an investor at both OpenAI and Anthropic and the founder of TL;DR AI himself.
</span>

And I will forever hold this DM close to my heart. Here's a screenshot.

</div>

I've been coding, building, and writing for a while now. In moments like these, all those times I questioned my choices finally fall into place.

<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>
Full circle moment.

## #2 Hacker News

Long story short, <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>an article that I authored, went viral on Hacker News (HN).</span> When I started, I hardly had any idea of what
HN was and what it meant to be on it's front page. I realised it was insanely hard to make it up there, when I started <span className="italic">attempting</span> to post some 
articles there.

For those who understand math over text, here are a few stats as brainstormed by Grok.

Estimates suggest there are about 1,300 submissions per day, and only a small fraction achieve significant attention, such as over 100 points, which is considered viral. This leads to an <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>estimated probability of 1 in 1,000</span>, though this is a rough figure and can vary.

To elaborate on the benefits we got from making it to the front page, apart from feeling great, take a  
look at the mixpanel dashboard below.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
<Image src="/small-wins/mixpanel.png" alt="HN Mixpanel" w="700"/>
</div>

The highest peak seen in the image, is from the day the article made it to the frontpage. We got a single-day traffic of 5K users and it continued to grow.
We created a momentum which kept propagating for many more weeks! Today the article has about 15.8K pageviews.
<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>
And that is the power of HN.
</span>

The article was titled <span className="italic">CI/CD Observability with OpenTelemetry</span>. Yep, not even a click-baity, catchy title. You can read the
entire article <a href="https://signoz.io/blog/cicd-observability-with-opentelemetry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:opacity-80">here</a>. It explains how you can
configure your OpenTelemetry collector to collect traces from your Github Actions CI/CD pipeline. 

I'll also attach a screenshot of the article featuring on the frontpage of HN.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
<Image src="/small-wins/hn-fp.png" alt="HN Frontpage" w="700"/>
</div>

This gained traction and we ended up collecting 150+ upvotes and 50+ comments.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
<Image src="/small-wins/hn-fp-2.png" alt="HN Comments" w="700"/>
</div>
 
 Now if you ask me for tips to do the same, I don't have any. There's no playbook for HN. It's pointless to spent time figuring one out as well.
You can have playbooks for almost every other platform, but surely not for HN, which is exactly what makes it nearly impossible to make it to teh frontpage as well.

The only tip/ general gyan I can give you is to put your 200% into what you build and write. 

<span style={{ color: 'var(--color-accent)' }}>
Try your best, for the rest will fall into place.
