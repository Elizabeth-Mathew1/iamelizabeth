# Welcome to MDX!

This is a sample MDX blog post that demonstrates how you can use **React components** directly in your markdown content.

<CalloutBox type="info" title="MDX is Awesome!">
  This is a custom CalloutBox component that you can use in your MDX content. It supports different types like info, warning, success, and error.
</CalloutBox>

## What is MDX?

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use JSX in your content. This means you can:

- Use React components
- Add interactive elements
- Create custom layouts
- Embed dynamic content

<CalloutBox type="warning" title="Important Note">
  When using MDX, make sure to import and register any custom components you want to use in your MDX files.
</CalloutBox>

## Example with a Custom Component

Here's an example of how you could use a custom component:

```jsx
<CustomComponent 
  title="Hello from MDX!"
  description="This component was rendered from MDX content"
/>
```

## Benefits of MDX

1. **Flexibility**: Mix markdown with React components
2. **Reusability**: Use the same components across your site
3. **Interactivity**: Add dynamic, interactive content
4. **Consistency**: Maintain your design system in blog posts

<CalloutBox type="success" title="Success!">
  You've successfully set up MDX support in your blog! You can now use React components in your markdown content.
</CalloutBox>

## Code Examples

You can also include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('MDX'));
```

## Conclusion

MDX gives you the best of both worlds - the simplicity of markdown with the power of React components. This makes it perfect for technical blogs, documentation, and any content that needs to be both readable and interactive.

<CalloutBox type="error" title="Remember">
  Always test your MDX components thoroughly to ensure they work correctly in your specific setup.
</CalloutBox>
