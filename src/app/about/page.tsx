        So getting to the facts that matter. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I currently work as a <span className="text-[var(--color-accent)]">Developer Relations Engineer at SigNoz (YC W21)</span>  (where I write more than I code). A typical work week includes coding for POCs, snippets,
        understanding how a feature works and any different use-cases, followed by blogging (written/ recorded) about them in a way, my dear readers will make sense of it. There&apos;s also distribution involved,
        and I&apos;m currently knee-deep in figuring out how to improve sign-ups from Reddit.
        <br/>
        I previously worked as a <span className="text-[var(--color-accent)]">Product Engineer at Inflection </span>(where I <span className="line-through"> cried</span> coded more than I slept). A typical work week was a mix of devloping features,
        reviewing code, resolving PR comments and a ton of debugging.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Growing up, I have always dreamt of being an engineer with a flashy laptop, working hard and making money (corporate slave). 10 years later, living the dream yet not fully living it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The only constant has been <span className="italic">ambition</span> and <span className="italic">desire</span> to do something big on my own and of my own.

          I&apos;m a developer, who codes and builds things. I&apos;m a great communicator, who loves to write and speak. I&apos;ve improved reduced AWS costs by 10% in my previous org and optimised architectures for messaging queues.
          I was a part of a deep tech blog that went viral on Hacker News generating a traffic of 15.34K till date. I learned all about MCP servers and made a POC MCP server for my org in roughly 2 days.

          other million smarter engineers on this planet.</span> Instead here is a more raw, honest and vulnerable pitch.
          <br/>
          <br/>
           I own my tasks from ideation to distribution to monitoring stats.
           I fix issuses before you catch them. You don&apos;t have to look at my work for errs, instead I hope I can look upto you and learn from you. Sometimes, I mess things up, but that happens only
           once in history. I don&apos;t repeat my mistakes (I really try my best). I&apos;ll help you grow your company, one step at a time (0&#8594;1 and 1&#8594;100). Tasks will be completed before the deadline. Always. I hit targets one 
           after the other, as much as my potential lets me.

        It&apos;s funny how we often ask kids who have zero idea about how the world functions, <span className="italic">what they want to be?</span>, but not to functional adults.

        Yes. Am I actually helping people who absolutely could use it? Nope.  Under a fa√ßade of solving problems, it was often how can I reduce AWS costs by 30% or how to improve traffic by 10%.
